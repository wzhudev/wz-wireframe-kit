## What's this?

`wz_wireframe_kit.sketch` contains lots of elements you can use in your wireframes files.

I have seen and used lots of wireframe kits. Though they are all beautiful enough, they are not friendly to others. They have no explanations telling how the app works. So I designed `wz_wireframe_kit.sketch` and hope it could be friendly to designers, product managers and engineers, making wireframe a useful tool for communication.

It has:

**iPhone 6 Mockup**. Four kinds of iPhone 6 mockups. Important, Blank, With Navigation, With Tab Bar. To bring convenience to your work.

**Placeholders**. Image Placeholders, Avatar Placeholders - Circle and Rounded Rectangle.

**Buttons**. Primary Buttons, Tiny Button, Circle Buttons.

**Links**. Arrow, Link, Click and Link, Action, Link With Action, etc.

**Tag**. Minimum and Maximum, Different Status, Interaction Explanations, If and Then, etc.

## How to use?

Download `wz_wireframe_kit_1.1.sketch`, open it. Then copy, paste and edit! That's easy!

Use `iPhone Mockups` and `Interface Elements` to sketch interfaces . Use `Links` to demonstrate relations among the screens. And use `Tags` to write interaction guidelines for engineers.

Here is an example for your reference, a news feed app wireframe. It's not finished but enough to show how to use the wireframe kit.
